This is a Web Scrapper built using Python and Flask Framework. It scraps Flipkart's website and shows all the user names, reviews, ratings, and descriptions given by that user. The front end part consists of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript while the Flask Framework controls the back-end part. The data that is received is stored in MongoDB. 

When searching for any product reviews, if the product is not present in the database, it is searched and fetched and displayed to the user and parallelly stored in the database. And if the product is already present then the data from the database is shown. 

This program can scarp the entire product list shown on Flipkart's Site. But it is limited to 5 products for demonstration and convenience
